Details of the assignment are below:

Overview – Student Registration Program

Your team assignment is to write a console application used to register students for a course.  The data for the registration system will be stored in one or more text files.  You will follow the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to develop the application using a waterfall methodology. I will provide a requirements document, but your team will be responsible for several other deliverables during each lifecycle phase:

Phase---------------Deliverable

Requirements -->    Requirements Document

Analysis -->        Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagram

Design -->          Technical Design 

Construction -->    Source Code, Version Control Sheet

Testing -->         Test Report

Implementation -->  Timely Submission to Assignments Folder

Please understand that the final grade on your team project is not based solely on the source code.  You will be graded based on each deliverable noted above.  In addition, your individual participation on the team project will be evaluated; subsequently, your grade may suffer if you do not actively contribute to your team assignment.

Assumptions:

The Use Case diagram can be created using any tool and will highlight all Use Cases for the system. 
You must submit all of your data files as a part of your assignment. 
Your source code must be submitted in a single zip file containing the group name. 
At a minimum, the version control sheet must include the name of the updated file, the date the change was made, the name of the person making the change, and a high-level description of the change. 
Have one person submit your final project to me. 
Your program will be designed using object oriented techniques.

Requirements:

The student registration system will display the list of courses available for registration.  
The program should show current registration numbers and available seats for each course.  
After a student successfully registers, the registration information should be stored in a file.

The system should provide several features: 

The ability for students to view an alphabetical list of courses that includes the course identification number, course dates, name, brief summary, the enrollment limit, and the number of students already enrolled. 
The ability for students to register or un-register for a course.
The ability for a student to see a list of classes for which he/she is currently registered. 

There are several business rules:

The system should not allow a student to register for a full course.
The system should not allow one student to view the registration information for another student. (Per teacher a username alone is sufficient ie password protection is not required)
The system should not allow a student to un-register from a course for which he/she is not registered.
